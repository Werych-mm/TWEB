                    I don't want a lot for Christmas <br>
                    There is just one thing I need <br>
                    (And I) don't care about the presents <br>
                    Underneath the Christmas tree <br>
                
                    I don't need to hang my stocking <br>
                    There upon the fireplace <br>
                    Santa Claus won't make me happy <br>
                    With a toy on Christmas Day <br>
                
                    I just want you for my own <br>
                    More than you could ever know <br>
                    Make my wish come true <br>
                    All I want for Christmas is you <br>

                    Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <br>
                    Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring  <br>
                    Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun <br>
                    Now the jingle hop has begun <br>

                    Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <br>
                    Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time <br>
                    Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square <br>
                    In the frosty air <br>

                    What a bright time, it's the right time <br>
                    To rock the night away <br>
                    Jingle bell time is a swell time <br>
                    To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh <br>

                    I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye <br>
                    Tell me, baby, do you recognize me? <br>

                    For black and for white (if you want it) <br>
                    For yellow and red ones (war is over) <br>

                        But it's hard to focus <br>

                        Let It Snow is blasting out <br>
                        But I won't get in the mood <br>
                        I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's <br>
